Processus coracoideus is attachment site of biceps caput breve and coracobrachialis

Biceps long head uses via point in DSEM/DAS model, how to best include this programmatically?

Discuss differences in activation parameters from muscle models DSEM vs OSIM with Ajay 

Segments for the radius and ulna not present in the DSEM, it has a Forearm segment that pronates and a massless intermediate segment for elbow flexion.
This structure likely needs to be addopted for proper conversion, as pronation RoM does not make sense with specified axis and location
OR HU joint is wrong
